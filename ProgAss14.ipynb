        "\n",
        "Certainly! Here's an example of a class that defines a generator to iterate over numbers divisible by 7 within a given range:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class DivisibleBySevenGenerator:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, n):\n",

        "\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "- The `DivisibleBySevenGenerator` class has an `__init__` method that takes a single argument `n`, which represents the upper limit of the range (inclusive).\n",
        "- The `generate_divisible_by_seven` method is a generator function that yields numbers divisible by 7 within the range from 0 to `n`.\n",
        "- The generator function uses a loop to iterate over the range from 0 to `n`. If the current number (`num`) is divisible by 7 (i.e., `num % 7 == 0`), it yields the number using the `yield` keyword.\n",
        "- When you create an instance of the `DivisibleBySevenGenerator` class and call the `generate_divisible_by_seven` method on that instance, it returns a generator object.\n",
        "- You can then iterate over the generator object using a loop or other iterator functions to obtain the numbers divisible by 7 within the given range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example usage of the class:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "generator = DivisibleBySevenGenerator(50)\n",
        "for number in generator.generate_divisible_by_seven():\n",
        "    print(number)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "```\n",
        "0\n",
        "7\n",

        "42\n",
        "49\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, an instance of the `DivisibleBySevenGenerator` class is created with `n` value as 50. The `generate_divisible_by_seven` method is then called, and a loop is used to iterate over the generated numbers divisible by 7 within the range from 0 to 50. Each number is printed as output."
