What is the distinction between a numpy array and a pandas data frame? Is there a way to convert between the two if there is?\n","\n","A NumPy array is a multi-dimensional array consisting of homogeneous data types, whereas a pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional table that can contain heterogeneous data types in its columns. A DataFrame in pandas can be thought of as a spreadsheet, with labeled columns of different types.\n","\n","One can convert a pandas DataFrame to a NumPy array using the `values` attribute of the DataFrame. For example, if `df` is a pandas DataFrame, then `df.values` will return a NumPy array. Similarly, a NumPy array can be converted to a pandas DataFrame using the `DataFrame` constructor. For example, if `arr` is a NumPy array, then `pd.DataFrame(arr)` will return a DataFrame."],"metadata":{"id":"rOnpERmoHyEo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q2. What can go wrong when an user enters in a stock-tickerÂ symbol, and how do you handle it?\n","\n","When a user enters a stock-ticker symbol, there are a few things that can go wrong, such as:\n","\n","1. The user may enter an incorrect symbol, which can lead to an error in the program when trying to retrieve data for the stock.\n","2. The user may enter a symbol for a stock that is no longer listed on the stock exchange, which can lead to an error in the program when trying to retrieve data for the stock.\n","3. The user may enter a symbol for a stock that is not available on the stock exchange in question, which can lead to an error in the program when trying to retrieve data for the stock.\n","\n","To handle these situations, the program can perform some basic error checking on the user's input, such as checking if the symbol is a valid one and if it is available on the specified stock exchange. If an error is detected, the program can display an appropriate error message to the user and prompt them to enter a valid symbol. If necessary, the program can also provide some guidance to the user on how to obtain the correct stock symbol."],"metadata":{"id":"1k5dpCltIAnb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q3. Identify some of the plotting techniques that are used to produce a stock-market chart.\n","\n","Here are some common plotting techniques used to produce a stock-market chart:\n","\n","1. Line chart: A simple line chart can be used to plot the closing price of a stock over time.\n","\n","2. Candlestick chart: A candlestick chart is commonly used to visualize the daily trading activity of a stock. The chart shows the opening and closing prices, as well as the highest and lowest prices for the day.\n","\n","3. Area chart: An area chart can be used to show the total value of a stock over time, by shading the area below the line.\n","\n","4. Volume chart: A volume chart can be used to visualize the trading volume of a stock over time. The height of the bars represents the trading volume for a given day.\n","\n","5. Moving average chart: A moving average chart is used to smooth out the noise in a stock's price data and make it easier to identify trends. It shows the average price of a stock over a certain period of time, typically 20 or 50 days.\n","\n","6. Bollinger Bands chart: Bollinger Bands are used to indicate the volatility of a stock's price over time. The chart shows the upper and lower bands, which are calculated as two standard deviations away from the moving average.\n","\n","7. Relative strength index (RSI) chart: An RSI chart is used to measure the strength of a stock's price action over time. The chart shows a line that oscillates between 0 and 100, with overbought and oversold levels at 70 and 30, respectively."],"metadata":{"id":"KRuNWBW_INga"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q4. Why is it essential to print a legend on a stock market chart?\n","\n","It is essential to print a legend on a stock market chart because it provides critical information about the data plotted in the chart. A legend labels the various lines or bars in the chart and explains what they represent, such as different stock tickers or indicators. Without a legend, it may be difficult or impossible for viewers to interpret the data accurately. A well-designed legend should be clear, concise, and accurately reflect the data plotted in the chart."],"metadata":{"id":"-2rM6qqsIbDr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q5. What is the best way to limit the length of a pandas data frame to less than a year?\n","\n","To limit the length of a pandas data frame to less than a year, you can use pandas' indexing and selection capabilities. One way to do this is to use boolean indexing with a condition that filters the rows based on a date range. For example, if you have a pandas data frame called `df` with a column called `date`, you can select rows from the past year using the following code:\n","\n","```\n","import pandas as pd\n","from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n","\n","# create a date range for the past year\n","last_year = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365)\n","\n","# filter the rows based on the date column\n","df_filtered = df[df['date'] >= last_year]\n","```\n","\n","This code creates a `datetime` object for the date one year ago from today's date and uses it to filter the rows in `df` based on the `date` column. The resulting `df_filtered` data frame contains only the rows from the past year."],"metadata":{"id":"0JQ3g5yLIlOU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q6. What is the definition of a 180-day moving average?\n","\n","A 180-day moving average is a technical analysis indicator that is calculated by adding up the closing prices of a financial security for the past 180 days and dividing the sum by 180. This creates an average price for the security over a 180-day period. The moving average is recalculated every day, using the most recent 180 days of data, and can help to smooth out short-term price fluctuations and identify longer-term trends. Traders and investors can use the 180-day moving average as a tool for making buy or sell decisions, with a moving average that is rising indicating an uptrend, while a falling moving average suggests a downtrend."],"metadata":{"id":"TigPJpjhIwGF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q7. Did the chapter's final example use \"indirect\" importing? If so, how exactly do you do it?\n","\n","Yes, the chapter's final example uses indirect importing. \n","\n","Indirect importing is accomplished by creating a third module that imports the two modules that require each other. This allows the third module to serve as a mediator, effectively breaking the circular dependency between the two modules. \n","\n","Here's an example of how you could use indirect importing:\n","\n","Suppose we have two modules, `module_a` and `module_b`, which depend on each other:\n","\n","```python\n","# module_a.py\n","import module_b\n","\n","def foo():\n","    module_b.bar()\n","\n","\n","# module_b.py\n","import module_a\n","\n","def bar():\n","    module_a.foo()\n","```\n","\n","To avoid the circular dependency, we can create a third module `module_c` that imports `module_a` and `module_b`, and then calls functions from `module_a` and `module_b` as needed:\n","\n","```python\n","# module_c.py\n","import module_a\n","import module_b\n","\n","def main():\n","    module_a.foo()\n","    module_b.bar()\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    main()\n","```\n","\n","Now, if we run `python module_c.py`, the `main` function in `module_c` will call `foo` from `module_a` and `bar` from `module_b`, without any circular dependencies."],"metadata":{"id":"Yxcv-NZNJETR"}}]}
