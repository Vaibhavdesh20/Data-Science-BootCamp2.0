What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n","\n","Python 3.8, which was released in October 2019, added several new features and improvements. Here are some of the notable ones:\n","\n","1. Assignment Expressions (the \"walrus\" operator): allows assignment within an expression, for example, `if (n:=len(my_list)) > 10:`\n","2. Positional-Only Parameters: allows specifying function arguments that can only be passed positionally, not as keyword arguments.\n","3. f-strings now support = for easier debugging.\n","4. Improved Reprlib: the reprlib module has been improved to better handle large or recursive data structures.\n","5. Syntax for Typed Dictionaries: PEP 589 introduced a new syntax for defining typed dictionaries.\n","6. New modules: The `importlib.metadata` module was added to provide a basic API for interacting with metadata for a distribution, and the `typing` module has been improved with new features.\n","7. Performance Improvements: Several performance improvements were made in Python 3.8, including faster module loading and improved memory usage.\n","\n","These are just some of the new features and improvements in Python 3.8."],"metadata":{"id":"QpF2m34p9cDa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2. What is monkey patching in Python?\n","\n","Monkey patching is a technique in Python that allows a programmer to modify or extend a module, class, object, or function at runtime without changing the original source code. In other words, you can modify the behavior of an existing object or function by replacing its code with new code during runtime. This technique can be useful in situations where you need to fix a bug in a third-party library or add new functionality to an existing object or function without having access to the original source code. However, monkey patching can also make the code harder to understand and maintain, and should be used with caution."],"metadata":{"id":"xj33lvai9ujl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3. What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?\n","\n","In Python, when copying an object such as a list, dictionary, or custom object, there are two types of copying: shallow copy and deep copy.\n","\n","A shallow copy creates a new object but references the same memory locations as the original object. Changes made to the copied object will be reflected in the original object and vice versa.\n","\n","On the other hand, a deep copy creates a new object and allocates new memory to store the copied values. Any changes made to the copied object will not affect the original object, and vice versa.\n","\n","To summarize, a shallow copy creates a new object that references the same memory as the original object, while a deep copy creates a new object with a new memory allocation, which is completely independent of the original object."],"metadata":{"id":"rbcgCJsZ998B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 4. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?\n","\n","In Python, the maximum length of an identifier is not officially specified. However, according to the Python documentation, most Python implementations limit identifiers to 255 bytes. However, it is generally not a good idea to use such long identifiers as they can make code difficult to read and maintain. It is recommended to keep identifiers concise and descriptive."],"metadata":{"id":"VguKlBwQ-KEO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 5. What is generator comprehension?\n","\n","Generator comprehension, also known as generator expression, is a concise way to create a generator object in Python. It follows a similar syntax to list comprehension but instead of creating a list, it creates a generator object that can be iterated over to produce values on-the-fly. \n","\n","The syntax for generator comprehension is similar to that of list comprehension, but with parentheses instead of brackets. For example, the following code creates a generator that generates the squares of the numbers from 0 to 9:\n","\n","```\n","gen = (x**2 for x in range(10))\n","```\n","\n","The generator comprehension can be used in situations where we don't need to create the entire sequence of values in advance, but rather we can generate and process the values one at a time. This can be more memory-efficient and faster in some cases than creating a list and iterating over it."],"metadata":{"id":"C2qpPxsJ-Wyx"}}]}
