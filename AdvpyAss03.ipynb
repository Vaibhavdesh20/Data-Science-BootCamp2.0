        "\n",
        "Abstract methods: An abstract superclass typically declares one or more abstract methods. These methods are defined in the superclass but lack implementation details. Subclasses that inherit from the abstract superclass are required to provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods. Abstract methods serve as placeholders, ensuring that specific behavior is implemented in the subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inability to instantiate: An abstract superclass cannot be directly instantiated because it is incomplete. It serves as a blueprint for its subclasses and provides a common structure and behavior that they inherit. Instead, concrete instances are created by instantiating the subclasses derived from the abstract superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inherited behavior: Subclasses of an abstract superclass inherit the non-abstract methods and attributes defined in the superclass. This allows the subclasses to reuse the shared behavior and functionality without redefining it. Inheritance ensures code reuse and promotes a hierarchical relationship between the superclass and its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: An abstract superclass enables polymorphism, which means that objects of different subclasses can be treated as instances of the superclass. This facilitates writing generic code that can operate on objects with different implementations but conforming to the common interface provided by the abstract superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interface definition: An abstract superclass often defines an interface that specifies a set of methods that subclasses must implement. This interface serves as a contract, ensuring that subclasses adhere to a specific structure and behavior."

        "1. Accessible Variables: In a class, variables defined within the class body (but not inside a method) are considered class-level variables and are accessible throughout the class. These variables can be accessed by all methods and instances of the class. In contrast, in a function, variables defined within the function body are local to that function and are only accessible within the function's scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Instance-specific Variables: In a class, instance variables are defined within the methods of the class and are unique to each instance of the class. They hold data specific to each instance and are accessed using the `self` parameter. Instance variables have a different scope compared to local variables within a function. In a function, local variables are created and destroyed each time the function is called, and their values are not retained between subsequent function calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Scope Hierarchy: Classes can have a hierarchical structure with inheritance, where subclasses inherit attributes and methods from their superclasses. In this case, the local scope of a subclass includes not only its own variables but also variables inherited from the superclass. This allows subclasses to access and override superclass variables and methods. On the other hand, in a function, the local scope does not have a hierarchical structure by default, and variables from outer scopes (such as global variables or variables from enclosing functions) need to be explicitly referenced using the `global` or `nonlocal` keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Lifetime: Class-level variables have a longer lifetime compared to local variables within a function. Class-level variables persist as long as the class object is alive, and their values are retained between method calls and instances. Local variables within a function, on the other hand, are created and destroyed each time the function is called, and their values are not retained between subsequent calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that both classes and functions can access variables from the global scope (i.e., variables defined outside the class or function). However, the primary difference lies in how the local scope is defined within the class (including class-level and instance-specific variables) and how it interacts with inheritance and object-oriented concepts."
