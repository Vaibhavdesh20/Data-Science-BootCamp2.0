What are the five levels of logging?\n","\n","The `logging` module in Python provides five standard levels of logging, in increasing order of severity:\n","\n","1. `DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n","2. `INFO`: General information about the program's operation, useful for keeping track of program flow.\n","3. `WARNING`: An indication that something unexpected happened or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The program is still working as expected.\n","4. `ERROR`: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n","5. `CRITICAL`: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n","\n","By default, the `basicConfig()` method sets the logging level to `WARNING`, which means that messages with a severity of `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL` will be logged. You can adjust the logging level as needed for your program by setting the level parameter when calling `basicConfig()` or when creating a logger object."],"metadata":{"id":"Uck3MH4XUMx2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?\n","\n","To disable all logging messages in your software, you can add the following line of code:\n","\n","```python\n","logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n","```\n","\n","This will disable all logging messages with a severity level of `CRITICAL` or lower, which includes all levels of logging. You can adjust the severity level as needed to disable logging messages of a higher or lower severity.\n","\n","Note that this line of code should be added after the logging configuration is set up using `basicConfig()` or a logger object. If you disable logging before configuring it, you may miss important error messages that would have helped you identify issues in your program."],"metadata":{"id":"avXg_nFCUb11"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n","\n","Using logging messages instead of print statements provides several benefits:\n","\n","1. **Granular control over message output**: With logging, you can specify which types of messages should be output, and where they should be output to (e.g. console, file, syslog, etc.). This allows you to fine-tune the amount and type of information that is logged, making it easier to find and diagnose issues.\n","\n","2. **Different levels of severity**: Logging messages have different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to easily identify and prioritize issues based on their severity. This can help you focus your debugging efforts on the most important issues first.\n","\n","3. **Contextual information**: With logging, you can include contextual information in your messages (such as the function or module name), which can help you understand the flow of execution and identify the source of issues more easily.\n","\n","4. **Easy to disable or enable**: With logging, you can easily enable or disable messages (or change their severity level) by modifying a single line of code, without having to comment or remove print statements throughout your code.\n","\n","5. **Built-in support for advanced features**: The logging module provides many advanced features, such as logging to multiple destinations, formatting messages, logging exceptions, and more, which can save time and simplify your debugging process.\n","\n","Overall, logging provides a more flexible and powerful way to manage program output and diagnose issues than simple print statements."],"metadata":{"id":"JttXC_1dUkCn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n","\n","The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons are commonly found in debuggers and are used to navigate through code while debugging. Here are the differences between these three buttons:\n","\n","1. **Step Over (also called Next)**: This button executes the current line of code, but does not stop inside any function calls that may be made on that line. In other words, it executes the current line and moves to the next line, regardless of whether there are function calls or not.\n","\n","2. **Step In (also called Step)**: This button executes the current line of code, and if that line contains a function call, it stops inside the function and allows you to debug the code inside the function.\n","\n","3. **Step Out**: This button continues execution until the current function is finished, and then stops at the line that called the function. This is useful when you are stepping through code line-by-line inside a function and want to quickly return to the calling code without executing the rest of the function.\n","\n","In summary, Step Over executes the current line of code and moves to the next line, Step In allows you to debug code inside a function, and Step Out continues execution until the current function is finished and then stops at the line that called the function. These buttons provide a powerful set of tools for navigating through code and debugging issues as they arise."],"metadata":{"id":"yatSMigKU1VO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n","\n","When you click the \"Continue\" button in a debugger, it will continue executing the program from the current point, without stopping at any further breakpoints or stepping through code line-by-line. The debugger will only stop again if it encounters another breakpoint, an unhandled exception, or if you manually pause or interrupt the program.\n","\n","In other words, the \"Continue\" button tells the debugger to resume normal program execution until the next breakpoint or stopping point is encountered. This can be useful when you want to quickly bypass a section of code that you know is working correctly, or if you want to test how the program behaves under normal, uninterrupted conditions."],"metadata":{"id":"f_hzjC52VAuu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n","\n","In programming, a breakpoint is a tool used by developers to pause program execution at a specific line of code for the purpose of debugging. When a breakpoint is set, the program will run until it reaches the specified line of code, at which point it will stop and wait for further instructions from the developer.\n","\n","Setting a breakpoint allows the developer to inspect the state of the program at that point, examine variable values, step through code line-by-line, and generally gain a better understanding of how the program is running. By stopping at a specific point in the code, developers can more easily identify and diagnose issues such as logic errors, unexpected behavior, or incorrect variable values.\n","\n","Breakpoints can be set in various ways depending on the development environment, but they are typically set by clicking on the line number in the code editor or by using a keyboard shortcut. Once set, breakpoints will remain in place until they are removed, even if the program is stopped and restarted.\n","\n","Overall, breakpoints are a powerful tool for debugging and can save developers a significant amount of time and effort when diagnosing issues in their code."],"metadata":{"id":"Jd8yDAp4VMG0"}}]}
