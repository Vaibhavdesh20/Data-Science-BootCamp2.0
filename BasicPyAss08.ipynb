Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?\n","\n","No, the Python Standard Library is not included with PyInputPlus. \n","\n","PyInputPlus is a third-party Python module that provides additional functionality for taking user input from the console. It includes features such as input validation, timeout support, and retrying input prompts. \n","\n","The Python Standard Library, on the other hand, is a collection of modules that are included with Python itself. It provides a wide range of functionality for tasks such as file I/O, networking, and data processing.\n","\n","While PyInputPlus may make use of some modules from the Python Standard Library, it is not a part of it and needs to be installed separately using pip or other package managers."],"metadata":{"id":"1JoAED1-IbNF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?\n","\n","PyInputPlus is commonly imported with the alias `pypi` using the statement `import pyinputplus as pypi` to make it easier to use the module in your code.\n","\n","The alias `pypi` is shorter and easier to type than the full name `pyinputplus`. Using an alias can also make your code more readable by allowing you to use a shorter name when referring to the module in your code.\n","\n","For example, instead of typing `pyinputplus.inputStr()`, you can use `pypi.inputStr()`. This can make your code easier to read and understand, especially if you are using multiple functions from the module in your code.\n","\n","In addition, using an alias can help avoid naming conflicts in your code. If you have another variable or module with the same name as `pyinputplus`, you can use the alias to distinguish between the two and prevent any errors or confusion.\n","\n","Overall, using an alias is a matter of personal preference, but it can make your code easier to read and write."],"metadata":{"id":"iS9ngyKeJSeO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?\n","\n","The `inputInt()` and `inputFloat()` functions in PyInputPlus are used to take input from the user and convert it to an integer or float value, respectively. \n","\n","The main difference between the two functions is the type of input they accept. \n","\n","The `inputInt()` function expects the user to enter an integer value. If the user enters a value that cannot be converted to an integer, PyInputPlus will raise a `ValidationException`.\n","\n","The `inputFloat()` function, on the other hand, expects the user to enter a floating-point value. This means the user can enter a decimal value, such as 3.14, which would not be accepted by `inputInt()`.\n","\n","Here's an example usage of both functions:\n","\n","```\n","import pyinputplus as pypi\n","\n","# Take an integer input\n","num1 = pypi.inputInt(\"Enter an integer: \")\n","\n","# Take a floating-point input\n","num2 = pypi.inputFloat(\"Enter a float: \")\n","```\n","\n","In the example above, `num1` will be an integer value and `num2` will be a float value. If the user enters a non-integer value for `num1` or a non-floating point value for `num2`, PyInputPlus will raise a `ValidationException`."],"metadata":{"id":"FYskfmnWJh_l"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?\n","\n","You can use the `inputInt()` function from PyInputPlus to ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99 by providing some additional arguments to the function.\n","\n","Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:\n","\n","```\n","import pyinputplus as pypi\n","\n","# Prompt the user to enter an integer between 0 and 99\n","num = pypi.inputInt(prompt='Enter a number between 0 and 99: ', min=0, max=99)\n","\n","# Print the user's input\n","print(f\"You entered: {num}\")\n","```\n","\n","In the code above, we pass the `prompt` argument to `inputInt()` to display a custom prompt message to the user. We also pass the `min` and `max` arguments to ensure that the user's input is between 0 and 99.\n","\n","If the user enters a value that is not an integer or is outside of the range of 0 to 99, PyInputPlus will raise a `ValidationException`. You can handle this exception using a `try`-`except` block to provide a custom error message to the user or perform some other action as appropriate."],"metadata":{"id":"5p9y_AxXJwm2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?\n","\n","The `allowRegexes` and `blockRegexes` keyword arguments in PyInputPlus are used to specify regular expressions that will be allowed or blocked, respectively, in user input.\n","\n","When using these keyword arguments, you pass a list of regular expressions as values. These regular expressions can be defined using Python's built-in `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions.\n","\n","The `allowRegexes` keyword argument specifies a list of regular expressions that the user's input must match in order to be considered valid. If the user's input does not match any of the regular expressions in the list, PyInputPlus will raise a `ValidationException`.\n","\n","The `blockRegexes` keyword argument, on the other hand, specifies a list of regular expressions that the user's input must not match in order to be considered valid. If the user's input matches any of the regular expressions in the list, PyInputPlus will raise a `ValidationException`.\n","\n","Here's an example of using both `allowRegexes` and `blockRegexes` keyword arguments:\n","\n","```\n","import pyinputplus as pypi\n","import re\n","\n","# Allow only even numbers between 0 and 100, but block the number 42\n","allow = [r'^[02468]$', r'^10{0,1}0$']\n","block = [r'^42$']\n","\n","num = pypi.inputInt(prompt='Enter an even number between 0 and 100 (except 42): ', \n","                    min=0, max=100, allowRegexes=allow, blockRegexes=block)\n","\n","print(f\"You entered: {num}\")\n","```\n","\n","In the example above, we define a list of regular expressions for `allowRegexes` that allows even numbers between 0 and 100, and a list of regular expressions for `blockRegexes` that blocks the number 42. When the user enters a number that matches the regular expressions in `allowRegexes` and does not match the regular expressions in `blockRegexes`, their input is considered valid. Otherwise, PyInputPlus will raise a `ValidationException`."],"metadata":{"id":"WckJnD7_J_3J"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?\n","\n","If a blank input is entered three times when using the `inputStr(limit=3)` function from PyInputPlus, the function will raise a `TimeoutException` after the third blank input.\n","\n","The `limit` keyword argument specifies the number of times the user can enter a blank input before PyInputPlus raises a `TimeoutException`. In this case, the limit is set to 3, which means that if the user enters a blank input three times in a row, PyInputPlus will raise the `TimeoutException`.\n","\n","Here's an example of how to use `inputStr()` with the `limit` keyword argument:\n","\n","```\n","import pyinputplus as pypi\n","\n","# Prompt the user to enter a non-blank string, with a limit of 3 blank inputs\n","response = pypi.inputStr(prompt='Enter a non-blank string: ', limit=3)\n","\n","# Print the user's response\n","print(f\"You entered: {response}\")\n","```\n","\n","In the example above, the user is prompted to enter a non-blank string. If the user enters a blank input, PyInputPlus will display an error message and ask the user to try again.

If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default='hello') do?\n","\n","\n","\n","The `inputStr(limit=3, default='hello')` function will prompt the user to enter some input and will limit the number of attempts to 3. If the user enters a non-blank input, the function will return the input. However, if the user enters a blank input (i.e., an empty string), the function will prompt the user again, up to the limit of 3 attempts. \n","\n","If the user fails to enter a non-blank input after three attempts, the function will return the default value `'hello'`.
