What does RGBA stand for?\n","\n","RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha, which is a color model used in computer graphics to represent colors with four values: red, green, blue, and alpha. The red, green, and blue values represent the color of the pixel, while the alpha value represents the opacity or transparency of the pixel. \n","\n","Each value is represented as an integer between 0 and 255 or as a floating-point number between 0 and 1. For example, the color white is represented as RGBA(255, 255, 255, 1) or RGBA(1, 1, 1, 1), while the color black is represented as RGBA(0, 0, 0, 1) or RGBA(0, 0, 0, 1).\n","\n","The RGBA color model is widely used in digital imaging and web design, and is supported by most modern web browsers and graphics software."],"metadata":{"id":"4oicBfcGcWtS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n","\n","To get the RGBA value of any images using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the `getpixel()` method of the `Image` object. The `getpixel()` method takes a tuple of `(x, y)` coordinates as input and returns the RGBA value of the pixel at that location as a tuple of four integers.\n","\n","Here's an example:\n","\n","```python\n","from PIL import Image\n","\n","# open an image file\n","img = Image.open('example.png')\n","\n","# get the size of the image\n","width, height = img.size\n","\n","# loop over each pixel in the image\n","for y in range(height):\n","    for x in range(width):\n","        # get the RGBA value of the pixel\n","        r, g, b, a = img.getpixel((x, y))\n","        \n","        # print the RGBA value\n","        print(f'Pixel at ({x}, {y}): ({r}, {g}, {b}, {a})')\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we use the `Image.open()` method to open an image file named `example.png`. We then use the `size` attribute to get the width and height of the image, and loop over each pixel in the image using nested `for` loops. For each pixel, we use the `getpixel()` method to get the RGBA value as a tuple of four integers, and print it to the console.\n","\n","Note that the `getpixel()` method can be slow for large images, since it accesses each pixel individually. If you need to manipulate the pixel data of an image in bulk, it may be more efficient to convert the image to a NumPy array using the `numpy.asarray()` method and manipulate the array directly."],"metadata":{"id":"rRard6kIcunT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n","\n","In the context of the Pillow module in Python, a box tuple is a tuple of four integers that represents a rectangular region in an image. The four integers represent the left, upper, right, and lower coordinates of the rectangle, respectively.\n","\n","The box tuple is used in various methods of the `Image` class, such as the `crop()`, `paste()`, and `resize()` methods, to specify a rectangular region of an image. For example, to crop an image to a rectangular region defined by the box tuple `(100, 100, 200, 200)`, you would use the following code:\n","\n","```python\n","from PIL import Image\n","\n","# open an image file\n","img = Image.open('example.png')\n","\n","# crop the image to a rectangular region defined by the box tuple\n","cropped_img = img.crop((100, 100, 200, 200))\n","\n","# save the cropped image to a file\n","cropped_img.save('cropped.png')\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we use the `crop()` method of the `Image` object to crop the image to the rectangular region defined by the box tuple `(100, 100, 200, 200)`. The resulting `cropped_img` object contains only the pixels within that region.\n","\n","The box tuple can also be used to define the size of a new image when creating a new `Image` object. For example, to create a new image with a size of 400x300 pixels, you would use the following code:\n","\n","```python\n","from PIL import Image\n","\n","# create a new image with a size of 400x300 pixels\n","new_img = Image.new('RGB', (400, 300), color='white')\n","\n","# save the new image to a file\n","new_img.save('new.png')\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we use the `Image.new()` method to create a new `Image` object with a size of 400x300 pixels, using the box tuple `(0, 0, 400, 300)` to define the size. The second argument to the `Image.new()` method specifies the color mode of the image (`'RGB'` in this case), and the third argument specifies the initial color of the image (`'white'` in this case)."],"metadata":{"id":"3w81MiTbdAKG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?\n","\n","To find out the width and height of an Image object using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the `size` attribute of the `Image` object. Here's an example:\n","\n","1. First, you need to install the Pillow module using `pip install Pillow` command in your terminal or command prompt.\n","\n","2.

Once you have the `Image` object, you can access its size using the `size` attribute:\n","\n","```python\n","# get the width and height of the image\n","width, height = img.size\n","\n","print('Width: ', width)\n","print('Height:', height)\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we use the `size` attribute of the `img` object to get its width and height. The `size` attribute returns a tuple containing the width and height of the image, which we unpack into the `width` and `height` variables.\n","\n","The output of the above code will be the width and height of the image in pixels."],"metadata":{"id":"bIjYgceTdSF6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n","\n","To get an `Image` object for a 100x100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the `crop` method of the `Image` object.

Then, we get the width and height of the image using the `size` attribute of the `Image` object.\n","\n","Next, we calculate the coordinates for the upper-left and lower-right corners of the box to crop. We want to exclude the lower-left quarter of the image, so we set the `left` and `top` coordinates to 0 and the `right` and `bottom` coordinates to `width - 50` and `height - 50`, respectively.\n","\n","Finally, we use the `crop` method of the `Image` object to crop the image using the coordinates we calculated, and save the result in a new `Image` object called `cropped_img`. We can then display the cropped image using the `show` method of the `Image` object.\n","\n","Note that the `crop` method takes a tuple containing the coordinates for the upper-left and lower-right corners of the box to crop.

After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n","\n","After making changes to an `Image` object using the Pillow module in Python, you can save it as an image file using the `save` method of the `Image` object.

We pass the filename we want to save the image as to the `save` method. The file format will be inferred from the file extension of the filename we provide.\n","\n","Note that the `save` method has a number of additional arguments we can use to control the format, compression, and other properties of the output file. For example, we can use the `format` argument to specify the file format explicitly, or the `quality` argument to set the image quality for JPEG files."],"metadata":{"id":"IffGAzbpd5Lt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n","\n","Pillow's shape-drawing code is contained in the `ImageDraw` module.

Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n","\n","You are correct that `Image` objects in Pillow do not have built-in drawing methods.
