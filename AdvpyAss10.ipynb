What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n","\n","`__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are two methods in Python that are related to attribute access on objects, but they have different purposes and behaviors.\n","\n","`__getattr__` is a special method in Python that is called when an attribute lookup fails. It is used to dynamically generate attributes on an object. For example, if you have an object `obj` and you try to access an attribute `foo` that doesn't exist on `obj`, Python will call `obj.__getattr__('foo')` to try to generate the attribute dynamically. If `__getattr__` is defined on the object, it can return a value for the requested attribute, or raise an `AttributeError` if the attribute cannot be generated.\n","\n","`__getattribute__`, on the other hand, is called for every attribute access on an object, whether the attribute exists or not. It is used to customize the behavior of attribute access on an object. If `__getattribute__` is defined on an object, Python will always call it first when an attribute is accessed. If the attribute exists, `__getattribute__` should return its value. If the attribute doesn't exist, `__getattribute__` should raise an `AttributeError`.\n","\n","The key difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` is that `__getattr__` is only called when an attribute lookup fails, while `__getattribute__` is always called for every attribute access, whether the attribute exists or not. This means that `__getattribute__` can be used to customize the behavior of attribute access on an object, while `__getattr__` is used to generate attributes dynamically when they don't already exist.\n","\n","It is important to be careful when implementing `__getattribute__`, as it can be used to override the default behavior of attribute access in Python, which can cause unexpected results if not used properly."],"metadata":{"id":"inIYbYHHs2EW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n","\n","Properties and descriptors are both mechanisms in Python for defining and customizing attribute access on objects, but they have different purposes and behaviors.\n","\n","Properties are a high-level mechanism for defining computed attributes on an object. They allow you to define a method-like interface for accessing or setting an attribute, while still providing the look and feel of a regular attribute. Properties are defined using the `@property` decorator in Python, and are accessed using the same syntax as regular attributes, for example `obj.my_property`.\n","\n","Descriptors, on the other hand, are a lower-level mechanism for defining attribute access on an object. They allow you to define custom behavior for attribute access and modification, such as data validation or attribute redirection. Descriptors are defined by creating a class with one or more of the special methods `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__`, which are called by Python when an attribute is accessed, set, or deleted. Descriptors are then assigned to a class attribute, which is used to control access to that attribute on instances of the class.\n","\n","The key difference between properties and descriptors is the level of control they provide over attribute access on objects. Properties are a simpler and more high-level mechanism for defining computed attributes, while descriptors provide more fine-grained control over attribute access and modification. Properties are generally easier to use and understand for simple cases, while descriptors are more appropriate for complex or advanced cases where more control over attribute access is required.\n","\n","Another difference is that properties are implemented using descriptors in Python. When you use the `@property` decorator to define a property, Python actually creates a descriptor object that implements the `__get__` method, which is used to retrieve the property value. This descriptor is then attached to the class attribute that defines the property. This means that properties are actually a special case of descriptors, with some of the behavior of descriptors abstracted away for convenience.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QLdO97ZEtVAi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as properties and descriptors?\n","\n","`__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are methods in Python that allow you to customize attribute access on objects, while properties and descriptors are mechanisms for defining and customizing attribute access on objects.
