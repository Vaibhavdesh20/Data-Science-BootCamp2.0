Parse the date from today_string.\n","\n","To parse the date from the `today_string`, you can use the `datetime` module in Python. Here's an example code that shows how to do this:\n","\n","```python\n","from datetime import datetime\n","\n","date_string = today_string.strip()  # Remove any whitespace or newline characters\n","date = datetime.strptime(date_string, '%Y-%m-%d')\n","```\n","\n","The `datetime.strptime()` method takes two arguments: the first is the string to be parsed, and the second is a string representing the format of the date in the input string. In this case, the input date is in the format of \"YYYY-MM-DD\", so the format string is '%Y-%m-%d'. The `strip()` method is used to remove any whitespace or newline characters that may be present in the `today_string` variable before parsing the date. The resulting `date` variable will contain a `datetime` object representing the parsed date."],"metadata":{"id":"dI56VAK-X-Gy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 4.
