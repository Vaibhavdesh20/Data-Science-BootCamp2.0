How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n","\n","\n","\n","`shutil.copy()` and `shutil.copytree()` are both functions in the `shutil` module of Python's standard library, but they have different purposes.\n","\n","`shutil.copy()` is used to copy a single file from one location to another. It takes two arguments: the source file path and the destination file path. The source file path can be either a string representing the path to the file, or a file-like object that has a `read()` method. The destination file path can be either a string representing the path to the new file, or a file-like object that has a `write()` method.\n","\n","Here's an example of how to use `shutil.copy()`:\n","\n","```python\n","import shutil\n","\n","shutil.copy('source_file.txt', 'destination_file.txt')\n","```\n","\n","This will copy the file `source_file.txt` to a new file `destination_file.txt`.\n","\n","`shutil.copytree()` is used to copy an entire directory tree from one location to another. It takes two arguments: the source directory path and the destination directory path. The source directory path must be a string representing the path to the directory you want to copy, and the destination directory path must be a string representing the path to the new directory where you want to copy the directory tree.\n","\n","Here's an example of how to use `shutil.copytree()`:\n","\n","```python\n","import shutil\n","\n","shutil.copytree('source_directory', 'destination_directory')\n","```\n","\n","This will copy the entire directory tree at `source_directory` to a new directory `destination_directory`. If the destination directory already exists, `shutil.copytree()` will raise an error unless the optional argument `dirs_exist_ok=True` is passed to the function."],"metadata":{"id":"WfOW8hcHPFx-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2. What function is used to rename files??\n","\n","The `os.rename()` function is used to rename files in Python. It is part of the `os` module of Python's standard library. The `os.rename()` function takes two arguments: the current name of the file and the new name that you want to give the file. Here is an example of how to use `os.rename()`:\n","\n","```python\n","import os\n","\n","current_name = 'old_name.txt'\n","new_name = 'new_name.txt'\n","\n","os.rename(current_name, new_name)\n","```\n","\n","This will rename the file `old_name.txt` to `new_name.txt`. Note that if the file `new_name.txt` already exists, the `os.rename()` function will overwrite it without warning."],"metadata":{"id":"l2zmtPQ7Pdyd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n","\n","The `send2trash` and `shutil` modules both provide functions to delete files and directories in Python, but they work in slightly different ways.\n","\n","The `send2trash` module provides a `send2trash()` function that moves files or directories to the system's trash or recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them. This allows you to recover deleted files if you accidentally delete them. Here's an example of how to use `send2trash()` to delete a file:\n","\n","```python\n","import send2trash\n","\n","filename = 'file_to_delete.txt'\n","send2trash.send2trash(filename)\n","```\n","\n","This will move the file `file_to_delete.txt` to the system's trash or recycle bin.\n","\n","On the other hand, the `shutil` module provides several functions to delete files and directories. The `os.remove()` function is used to delete a single file, and the `shutil.rmtree()` function is used to delete a directory and all of its contents recursively. Here's an example of how to use `shutil.rmtree()` to delete a directory:\n","\n","```python\n","import shutil\n","\n","directory_name = 'directory_to_delete'\n","shutil.rmtree(directory_name)\n","```\n","\n","This will delete the directory `directory_to_delete` and all of its contents.\n","\n","One key difference between these modules is that `send2trash` moves files and directories to the trash or recycle bin, which means they can potentially be recovered later. In contrast, the `shutil` functions permanently delete files and directories without the possibility of recovery."],"metadata":{"id":"kXKTV0qhPqS2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n","\n","The `ZipFile` method equivalent to the `File` object's `open()` method is `ZipFile()` itself. \n","\n","Just like how `open()` returns a `File` object, `ZipFile()` returns a `ZipFile` object that allows you to read, write, or modify a ZIP archive.\n","\n","Here is an example of how to use `ZipFile()` to open a ZIP archive for reading:\n","\n","```python\n","import zipfile\n","\n","with zipfile.ZipFile('archive.zip', 'r') as zip_file:\n","    # Use the ZipFile object to read from the archive\n","    file_contents = zip_file.read('file.txt')\n","    print(file_contents)\n","```\n","\n","This will open the file `archive.zip` in read mode, allowing you to read its contents. The `ZipFile.read()` method is then used to read the contents of the file `file.txt` inside the archive.\n","\n","Similarly, you can use `ZipFile()` to create a new ZIP archive for writing or to append to an existing ZIP archive by specifying the mode parameter as `'w'` or `'a'` respectively.\n","\n","```python\n","import zipfile\n","\n","with zipfile.ZipFile('new_archive.zip', 'w') as zip_file:\n","    # Use the ZipFile object to write to the new archive\n","    zip_file.write('file.txt')\n","```\n","\n","This will create a new ZIP archive named `new_archive.zip` and add the file `file.txt` to it."],"metadata":{"id":"f5Nx-MDhP7xr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg).
