        "Prior probability, also known as prior belief or prior distribution, refers to the initial probability assigned to an event or hypothesis before any new evidence or data is taken into account. It represents the subjective belief or knowledge about the likelihood of an event or hypothesis based on prior information, experience, or assumptions.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Let's consider a scenario where a medical test is conducted to diagnose a rare disease. The prior probability in this case could be the estimated prevalence rate of the disease in the general population before any test results are known. For instance, if the prevalence rate is known to be 0.1% (or 0.001), the prior probability of an individual having the disease would be 0.001.\n",

        "The prior probability is typically based on existing data, historical information, expert opinions, or previous research. It serves as a starting point or initial belief before incorporating new evidence or data through the process of Bayesian inference.\n",

        "In Bayesian statistics, the prior probability is combined with the likelihood (probability of the observed data given the hypothesis) to calculate the posterior probability (updated probability after considering the new evidence). The prior probability influences the initial weight given to different hypotheses or events, and it can be updated and revised as new evidence becomes available.\n",

        "The prior probability plays a crucial role in Bayesian analysis, as it allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge or beliefs into the probabilistic inference process. However, it is important to note that the choice of the prior can impact the final results, and different individuals or researchers may have different prior beliefs, leading to different posterior probabilities."

Independence Assumption: The Bayes classifier assumes that all features are independent of each other, meaning that the presence or absence of one feature does not affect the presence or absence of any other feature.
