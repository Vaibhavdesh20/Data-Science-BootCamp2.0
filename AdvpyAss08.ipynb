What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n","\n","As an AI language model, I don't have access to the latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X beyond the knowledge cutoff of September 2021. However, I can explain what user-defined exceptions are and give you an overview of how they work in Python.\n","\n","In Python, you can create your own exceptions by defining a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. By doing this, you can create custom exception types that have specific names, error messages, and behaviors.\n","\n","Here's an example of how to define a custom exception class in Python:\n","\n","```python\n","class MyException(Exception):\n","    pass\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we're defining a new exception class called MyException that inherits from the built-in Exception class. The pass statement inside the class definition means that we're not adding any new functionality to the MyException class beyond what's already defined in the Exception class.\n","\n","Once you've defined your custom exception class, you can raise instances of it in your code using the raise statement, like this:\n","\n","```python\n","raise MyException(\"Something went wrong!\")\n","```\n","\n","This will create a new instance of the MyException class with the error message \"Something went wrong!\" and raise it, causing the program to terminate unless the exception is caught and handled by a try-except block or similar construct.\n","\n","It's worth noting that while there may be new user-defined exception constraints added in later versions of Python 3.X beyond my knowledge cutoff, the basic principles of creating and raising custom exceptions remain the same."],"metadata":{"id":"0aMB35YfVRJW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n","\n","In Python, when you raise an exception using the raise statement, the interpreter starts searching for a matching exception handler to catch and handle the exception. This process is called exception handling.\n","\n","To match an exception to a handler, Python looks for the nearest enclosing try statement that matches the type of the raised exception. If a matching except block is found, the statements in that block are executed, and control is transferred to the first statement after the try-except block.\n","\n","If no matching except block is found, the exception propagates up the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program. If the exception is still unhandled at that point, the interpreter terminates the program and prints a traceback that shows the chain of function calls that led to the unhandled exception.\n","\n","Here's an example that demonstrates how class-based exceptions are matched to handlers in Python:\n","\n","```python\n","class MyException(Exception):\n","    pass\n","\n","try:\n","    # Some code that may raise an exception\n","    raise MyException(\"Something went wrong!\")\n","except MyException as e:\n","    print(\"Caught an instance of MyException:\", e)\n","except Exception as e:\n","    print(\"Caught an instance of a different exception:\", e)\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we define a custom exception class called MyException, then raise an instance of it inside a try block. We then define two except blocks - the first one matches instances of MyException, while the second one matches all other types of exceptions.\n","\n","When we run this code, the interpreter starts searching for a matching try block, and finds the one that we've defined. It then raises an instance of MyException, which matches the first except block, since it's of the same type. The code inside the first except block is then executed, printing the message \"Caught an instance of MyException: Something went wrong!\".\n","\n","If the exception raised had not been an instance of MyException, then the interpreter would have searched for the nearest enclosing try block that matches the type of the raised exception, and continued propagating the exception up the call stack until it either finds a matching handler or reaches the top-level of the program."],"metadata":{"id":"rTQ9DnLDVwxA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n","\n","Attaching context information to exception artifacts can be very useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues in a Python program. There are several methods you can use to attach context information to exceptions in Python. Here are two commonly used methods:\n","\n","1. Adding context to the exception message: \n","\n","When you raise an exception in Python, you can include additional context information in the exception message itself. This can help you quickly identify the source of the problem when the exception is raised.\n","\n","```python\n","try:\n","    # Some code that may raise an exception\n","    raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: {}\".format(user_input))\n","except ValueError as e:\n","    print(\"Caught a ValueError exception:\", e)\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we're raising a ValueError exception with a custom error message that includes the value of the user input that caused the error. When the exception is caught, the error message will be printed to the console, providing additional context information to help diagnose the issue.\n","\n","2. Adding context to the exception object:\n","\n","Another way to attach context information to exception artifacts is to add attributes to the exception object itself. This can be especially useful when you need to include detailed information about the state of the program when the exception was raised.\n","\n","```python\n","try:\n","    # Some code that may raise an exception\n","    raise RuntimeError(\"Something went wrong\")\n","except RuntimeError as e:\n","    e.line_number = 42\n","    e.file_name = \"example.py\"\n","    print(\"Caught a RuntimeError exception:\", e)\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we're raising a RuntimeError exception and then adding two attributes to the exception object: line_number and file_name. These attributes provide additional context information that can be used to diagnose the issue. When the exception is caught, the error message and the additional context information will be printed to the console.\n","\n","By using these methods, you can attach context information to exception artifacts in Python and improve your ability to diagnose and troubleshoot issues in your program."],"metadata":{"id":"ZS5JHaHlW5v9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message.\n","\n","When raising an exception in Python, you can specify the text of the error message in several ways. Here are two methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message:\n","\n","1. Using a string literal:\n","\n","The most common way to specify the text of an exception object's error message is to use a string literal. This can be a simple string, or it can include placeholders that will be filled in with values at runtime using string formatting.\n","\n","```python\n","try:\n","    # Some code that may raise an exception\n","    raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: {}\".format(user_input))\n","except ValueError as e:\n","    print(\"Caught a ValueError exception:\", e)\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we're raising a ValueError exception with a custom error message that includes the value of the user_input variable.

Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n","\n","String-based exceptions were deprecated in Python 2.x and removed in Python 3.x. Instead of using string-based exceptions, Python now uses classes to define exceptions. There are several reasons why string-based exceptions were removed:\n","\n","1. Lack of clarity: \n","\n","String-based exceptions provided limited information about the error that occurred. They were often generic and did not provide much context to help diagnose the issue.\n","\n","2. No hierarchy: \n","\n","With string-based exceptions, there was no clear hierarchy to the exceptions. This made it difficult to handle exceptions in a structured way and forced developers to write custom code to handle each exception individually.\n","\n","3. No type checking:\n","\n","With string-based exceptions, there was no way to perform type checking on exceptions. This made it difficult to catch specific types of exceptions and required developers to manually parse the exception message to determine the type of exception.\n","\n","4. Error-prone: \n","\n","Using string-based exceptions could be error-prone. Developers could easily mistype an exception name or include typos in the exception message, which could make it difficult to diagnose the issue.\n","\n","By using classes to define exceptions, Python provides a more structured and robust way of handling errors. Classes allow for a clear hierarchy of exceptions, type checking, and provide additional context information to help diagnose issues. Additionally, classes can be extended and customized, allowing developers to create their own exceptions to handle specific use cases."],"metadata":{"id":"cyFeJ5eqZIlF"}}]}
