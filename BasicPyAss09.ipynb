To what does a relative path refer?\n","\n","A relative path is a file or directory path that is defined relative to the current working directory of the program or user. It specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to the current directory or the location of the program that is executing the path.\n","\n","For example, suppose you have a directory structure as follows:\n","\n","```\n","project/\n","    folder1/\n","        file1.txt\n","    folder2/\n","        file2.txt\n","    main.py\n","```\n","\n","If the current working directory is `project`, then the relative path to `file1.txt` would be `folder1/file1.txt`, and the relative path to `file2.txt` would be `folder2/file2.txt`. \n","\n","Similarly, if the program `main.py` wants to open `file1.txt` for reading, it can use the relative path `folder1/file1.txt`, assuming the program is executed from the `project` directory.\n","\n","Relative paths are useful because they allow for more flexible and portable code, as the same code can be executed from different directories without needing to modify the absolute paths to files and directories."],"metadata":{"id":"uEQbnNKYMHzq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2. What does an absolute path start with your operating system?\n","\n","In most operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, and macOS), an absolute path starts with the root directory of the file system, which is denoted by a special character or symbol.\n","\n","For example, in Windows, the root directory is usually `C:\\`, so an absolute path to a file might look like `C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\file.txt`. In Linux and macOS, the root directory is denoted by a forward slash `/`, so an absolute path to a file might look like `/home/username/Documents/file.txt`.\n","\n","The use of an absolute path ensures that the file or directory can be uniquely identified and accessed regardless of the current working directory of the program or user. Unlike relative paths, absolute paths always start from the same point, which is the root directory of the file system."],"metadata":{"id":"jiHRASvpMZU-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3. What do the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do?\n","\n","The `os.getcwd()` function and `os.chdir()` function are used in Python's `os` module to get and change the current working directory.\n","\n","`os.getcwd()`: This function returns a string representing the current working directory of the Python script that is executing. It does not take any argument. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","import os\n","current_dir = os.getcwd()\n","print(\"Current working directory:\", current_dir)\n","```\n","\n","This will output the current working directory of the Python script that is executing.\n","\n","`os.chdir(path)`: This function is used to change the current working directory to the directory specified by `path`. It takes a string argument that represents the path of the directory to which the current working directory is to be changed. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","import os\n","os.chdir('/home/user/Desktop')\n","print(\"Current working directory:\", os.getcwd())\n","```\n","\n","This code changes the current working directory to the `Desktop` directory in the `user` home directory (in a Linux-based operating system), and then prints the current working directory. Note that this function may raise an exception if the specified directory does not exist or if the user does not have permission to access the directory.\n","\n","Together, these functions provide a way to manage the current working directory of a Python script, which is useful when working with files and directories in different locations on the file system."],"metadata":{"id":"uSqxwOhuMl_9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 4. What are the . and .. folders?\n","\n","In most operating systems, the `.` and `..` folders are special folders that represent the current directory and the parent directory, respectively.\n","\n","The `.` (dot) folder is used to represent the current directory, and is sometimes referred to as the \"current working directory\". For example, in a Unix-based system, if a user is currently in the directory `/home/user/Documents`, then the `.` folder represents the `/home/user/Documents` directory.\n","\n","The `..` (dot-dot) folder is used to represent the parent directory of the current directory. For example, if a user is currently in the directory `/home/user/Documents`, then the `..` folder represents the `/home/user` directory.\n","\n","These folders are useful when navigating through directories and specifying file paths. For example, in a Unix-based system, the file path `../file.txt` refers to the file `file.txt` in the parent directory of the current directory.\n","\n","It is worth noting that the `.` and `..` folders are hidden folders in many operating systems, and are not displayed by default in file explorers or terminal listings. To display these folders, the user may need to enable a setting or use a command-line option.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"L70cPI0DM4aQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 5. In C:\\bacon\\eggs\\spam.txt, which part is the dir name, and which part is the base name?\n","\n","In the file path `C:\\bacon\\eggs\\spam.txt`:\n","\n","- `C:\\bacon\\eggs` is the directory or folder name.\n","- `spam.txt` is the base name or file name.\n","\n","The directory or folder name refers to the path of the directory or folder that contains the file `spam.txt`. In this case, the directory or folder name is `C:\\bacon\\eggs`.\n","\n","The base name or file name refers to the name of the file itself, without the directory or folder path. In this case, the base name or file name is `spam.txt`.\n","\n","When working with file paths, it is important to distinguish between the directory or folder path and the file name, as they may need to be treated differently in certain operations, such as opening or manipulating files."],"metadata":{"id":"6IzzD_fJNKMN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 6. What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the open() function?\n","\n","The `open()` function in Python can take three mode arguments, which specify how the file is to be opened and read or written. These mode arguments are:\n","\n","1. `r` (read mode): This is the default mode, and is used for opening a file for reading. If the file does not exist, this mode will raise an error. For example, `open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")` opens the file `file.txt` for reading.\n","\n","2. `w` (write mode): This mode is used for opening a file for writing. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. For example, `open(\"file.txt\", \"w\")` opens the file `file.txt` for writing.\n","\n","3. `a` (append mode): This mode is used for opening a file for appending data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. For example, `open(\"file.txt\", \"a\")` opens the file `file.txt` for appending data.\n","\n","These mode arguments can also be combined with additional characters to specify more options. For example, `r+` opens a file for both reading and writing, `w+` opens a file for reading and writing, and creates a new file if it does not exist, and `a+` opens a file for both appending and reading."],"metadata":{"id":"qBqNgNluNXZq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?\n","\n","If an existing file is opened in write mode (`\"w\"`), the contents of the file will be truncated, and any previous data in the file will be lost. The file will be opened for writing, but any existing data in the file will be deleted.\n","\n","For example, consider the following code:\n","\n","```python\n","with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n","    f.write(\"Hello, world!\")\n","```\n","\n","In this case, if the file `\"file.txt\"` already exists, its contents will be replaced with the string `\"Hello, world!\"`. Any previous data in the file will be lost.\n","\n","If the file `\"file.txt\"` does not exist, a new file will be created with the name `\"file.txt\"`, and the string `\"Hello, world!\"` will be written to the file.\n","\n","It is important to be careful when opening files in write mode, as any existing data in the file will be lost. If you want to add new data to an existing file without overwriting its contents, you should open the file in append mode (`\"a\"`), which will append the new data to the end of the file without deleting any existing data."],"metadata":{"id":"jUs6F_FLNl_d"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 8. How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?\n","\n","The `read()` and `readlines()` methods are used to read data from a file in Python, but they behave differently.\n","\n","The `read()` method reads the entire contents of the file as a single string, and returns that string. If you do not specify a size argument, `read()` will read the entire contents of the file. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n","    data = f.read()\n","    print(data)\n","```\n","\n","In this case, `read()` reads the entire contents of the file `\"file.txt\"` as a single string, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The `print()` statement then prints the contents of the file.\n","\n","The `readlines()` method, on the other hand, reads the contents of the file line by line, and returns a list of strings, where each string is a line in the file. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n","    lines = f.readlines()\n","    for line in lines:\n","        print(line)\n","```\n","\n","In this case, `readlines()` reads the contents of the file `\"file.txt\"` line by line, and assigns a list of strings, where each string is a line in the file, to the variable `lines`. The `for` loop then iterates over each line in the list, and prints each line to the console.\n","\n","So, the main difference between `read()` and `readlines()` is that `read()` reads the entire contents of the file as a single string, while `readlines()` reads the contents of the file line by line, and returns a list of strings."],"metadata":{"id":"Hw8_tajnOQZJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?\n","\n","In Python, the `shelve` module provides a persistent dictionary-like object, which can be used to store key-value pairs. A shelf is similar to a dictionary in that it maps keys to values, but it differs from a regular dictionary in that the data is stored on disk rather than in memory.\n","\n","A shelf value in Python resembles a dictionary, since it is a collection of key-value pairs. However, since the data is stored on disk, the shelf value is actually an instance of the `dbm.gnu` database module (on Unix) or the `dbm.ndbm` database module (on Windows).\n","\n","The values in a shelf are pickled before they are stored, which means that any Python object can be stored as a value in a shelf. When the value is retrieved from the shelf, it is automatically unpickled, so it can be used just like any other Python object.\n","\n","To access a shelf value, you can use the same syntax as for accessing a dictionary value, like this:\n","\n","```python\n","import shelve\n","\n","# Open a shelf file\n","with shelve.open(\"mydata\") as shelf:\n","    # Add some data to the shelf\n","    shelf[\"name\"] = \"Alice\"\n","    shelf[\"age\"] = 42\n","\n","    # Retrieve some data from the shelf\n","    print(shelf[\"name\"])\n","    print(shelf[\"age\"])\n","```\n","\n","In this example, the shelf file `\"mydata\"` is opened, and some data is added to it using dictionary-like syntax. The data can then be retrieved from the shelf using the same syntax."],"metadata":{"id":"1WvK4AhHOfcX"}}]}
