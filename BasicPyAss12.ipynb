This is because PDF files are binary files and should be treated as such when being read.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader\n","\n","with open('input.pdf', 'rb') as file:\n","    pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file)\n","```\n","\n","- `PdfFileWriter()`: The file object should also be opened in binary mode using the \"wb\" mode.

From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?\n","\n","To get a `Page` object for a specific page from a `PdfFileReader` object in PyPDF2, you can use the `getPage()` method and pass in the index of the page you want (indexed from 0). So to get a `Page` object for page 5 (index 4), you can use the following code:\n","\n","```python\n","from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader\n","\n","with open('document.pdf', 'rb') as file:\n","    pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file)\n","    page_5 = pdf_reader.getPage(4) # get the 5th page (index 4)\n","```\n","\n","In the above example, `page_5` will be a `Page` object representing the fifth page of the PDF document.

What PdfFileReader variable stores the number of pages in the PDF document?\n","\n","In PyPDF2, the number of pages in a PDF document is stored in the `numPages` attribute of a `PdfFileReader` object. \n","\n","Here's an example of how to use it:\n","\n","```python\n","from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader\n","\n","with open('document.pdf', 'rb') as file:\n","    pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file)\n","    num_pages = pdf_reader.numPages\n","    print(\"Number of pages:\", num_pages)\n","```\n","\n","In the above example, `num_pages` will be an integer representing the total number of pages in the PDF document.

If it is, we attempt to decrypt it with the password \"swordfish\" using the `decrypt()` method.

What methods do you use to rotate a page?\n","\n","In PyPDF2, you can rotate a page in a PDF document using the `rotateClockwise()` and `rotateCounterClockwise()` methods of a `Page` object. These methods rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively. You can also use the `rotateClockwise(angle)` and `rotateCounterClockwise(angle)` methods to rotate the page by a custom angle in degrees.\n","\n","Here's an example of how to use these methods to rotate a page:\n","\n","```python\n","from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter\n","\n","with open('input.pdf', 'rb') as file:\n","    pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(file)\n","    pdf_writer = PdfFileWriter()\n","\n","    # rotate the first page of the PDF 90 degrees clockwise\n","    page = pdf_reader.getPage(0)\n","    page.rotateClockwise(90)\n","\n","    # add the rotated page to the output PDF\n","    pdf_writer.addPage(page)\n","\n","    # write the output PDF to a file\n","    with open('output.pdf', 'wb') as output_file:\n","        pdf_writer.write(output_file)\n","```\n","\n","In the above example, we first get the first page of the input PDF using the `getPage()` method, and then rotate it 90 degrees clockwise using the `rotateClockwise()` method. We then add the rotated page to a new `PdfFileWriter` object using the `addPage()` method, and write the output PDF to a file using the `write()` method.

What is the difference between a Run object and a Paragraph object?\n","\n","In Microsoft Word, a `Paragraph` object represents a single paragraph of text, while a `Run` object represents a contiguous run of characters within a paragraph that share the same text formatting (such as font, size, boldness, italics, etc.).\n","\n","Here's an example of how to create a `Paragraph` object and a `Run` object in Python using the `python-docx` library:\n","\n","```python\n","from docx import Document\n","from docx.shared import Pt\n","\n","document = Document()\n","\n","# create a new paragraph object\n","paragraph = document.add_paragraph()\n","\n","# add some text to the paragraph\n","paragraph.add_run('This is a ')\n","\n","# add a run of bold text to the paragraph\n","bold_run = paragraph.add_run('bold')\n","bold_run.bold = True\n","\n","# add some more text to the paragraph\n","paragraph.add_run(' sentence.')\n","\n","# set the font size of the whole paragraph\n","paragraph.style.font.size = Pt(12)\n","```\n","\n","In the above example, we first create a new `Paragraph` object using the `add_paragraph()` method of a `Document` object.

We then set the `bold` attribute of `bold_run` to `True` to make the text bold. Finally, we add some more text to the paragraph and set the font size of the whole paragraph to 12 points.\n","\n","So in summary, a `Paragraph` object represents a block of text, while a `Run` object represents a subset of that text with shared formatting.

How do you obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object that’s stored in a variable named doc?\n","\n","In the `python-docx` library, you can obtain a list of `Paragraph` objects for a `Document` object using the `paragraphs` attribute.
